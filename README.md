[`zlenner/elections-data`](https://github.com/zlenner/elections-data) is an attempt to translate image scans of ECP Form-33s into machine-readable JSON:

**Punjab**: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-Sjn24YKSR10-WmmFpWDRRO1csDe8TMj

**Sindh**: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YPqxEW6Jku1D9G9GE19HqXCyF7PiO6ff

**Khyber Pakhtunkhwa**: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1cxPb0EYMBcrYivV3XB54bkZadsIc67uY

**Balochistan**: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P4CaSxjhZIIfSxZCHdp843QNbzl7n0Lm

[fix.azaadvote.com](https://fix.azaadvote.com) displays that data as a table along with the original Form-33 image side-by-side.

## ⚠️ WE NEED YOUR HELP ⚠️

We use **gpt4-vision** to transcribe the images into JSON. It's not perfect.

We need to devise a way on this site to allow users to correct the JSON data.

One of the ideas is to have a Google Sheets/Airtable iframe instead of the table on the right that lets authenticated users easily edit and correct errors without having to leave the wesite.

We have **_VERY_** little time until February 8th. Submit a PR directly or reach out to me on @clynergy if you can build this.
